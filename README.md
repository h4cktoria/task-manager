_Task Management has never been so easy!_

<img src="task-manager.PNG" align="center" />

Important note: this is __NOT A REAL PROGRAM__! This has been made, works and will work only in the game called Grey Hack!


## Objectives

Task Manager aims to bring the functionality of Activity Manager(from Microsoft Windows) or Process Monitor(from GNU/Linux) into the Grey Hack


## Features

There are some of the features that Task Manager has:

- Htop mode: Watch for tasks appearance and disappearance in real time
- Guard mode: Terminate any task that appeared just after you launched this mode
- Termination: Terminate selected tasks
- Snapshotting: Create snapshots of selected tasks
- Keyboard controls: One button for one command. No long commands that you need to type in


## Known Bugs

- None so far, so You tell me!


## Installation Guide

Easy way:
- Download __OneFileVersion.src__ and compile it
